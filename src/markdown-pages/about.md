## Who, What, Why?

Hi there! Welcome to my (@blackspherefollower) curated list of just about every computer controllable sex toy I've been able to find, including some that others have told me about.
I'm a generally quiet software engineer with a hobby of discovering and documenting the protocols used by sex toys (specifically the kind that are designed to be controlled by some form of computer).

This site is a filterable/searchable list of all the devices I've found reference to online, including as much information as I can find regarding the device's technical attributes. Not all these devices ever made it it production (I've fairly sure a couple are April fools jokes), others have already been discontinued; they're still included here because I'm trying to make this as complete a list as possible.

This is not a sex toy review site (although links to reviews may be included at some point): whilst I admit I have a spending issue when it comes to sextech, there's no way I can acquire all these devices, and of those that I can, most are not designed for my anatomy. Furthermore this is intended to be a fact list, and usage reviews are by definition subjective to the reviewer's tastes.

So why am I doing this? Because nobody else is, and since I've been collating this data, why not share it?

I've seen a few requests for such a resource, but far more often I see requests for "a device that does X and is shape Y". The aim is to get the filter system to a point where those answers are just a few clicks away.

## What's with the horrible name?

I'm trying not to step on the toes of the other members of the sextech community. Go see the awesome work others are doing:

- [https://buttplug.io/](https://buttplug.io/)
- [https://internetofdon.gs/](https://internetofdon.gs/)
- [https://openprivacy.ca/](https://openprivacy.ca/)

There's way more that should be on this list, and I'll add to it over time.
